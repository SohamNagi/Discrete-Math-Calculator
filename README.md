Mathematical Utility Toolbox

Overview
The Mathematical Utility Toolbox is a versatile Python script that serves as a one-stop solution for various mathematical computations and analyses. This toolbox provides a collection of mathematical functions, including:

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator: Quickly find the GCD of two numbers.

Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) Explorer: Visualize the EEA table and compute BÃ©zout coefficients.

Prime Number Checker: Determine if a number is prime or composite.

Linear Diophantine Equation Solver (LDE): Solve linear Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c.

Prime Factor List Generator: Identify prime factors of a given integer.

Factor List Generator: List all factors of a given number.

Remainder Calculator: Compute the remainder when one number is divided by another.

Coprime Checker: Check if two numbers are coprime (having a GCD of 1).

Modulus Calculator: Easily calculate x mod y for any two numbers.

Usage
This project provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface that allows users to select their desired mathematical operation. Simply choose an option from the menu, input the required values, and receive the result promptly.
