<h1>Mathematical Utility Toolbox</h1>

<H2>Overview</H2>
The Mathematical Utility Toolbox is a versatile Python script that serves as a one-stop solution for various mathematical computations and analyses. This toolbox provides a collection of mathematical functions, including:

<ul>
<li><b>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator:</b> Quickly find the GCD of two numbers.</li>

<li><b>Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) Explorer: </b>Visualize the EEA table and compute BÃ©zout coefficients.</li>

<li><b>Prime Number Checker: </b>Determine if a number is prime or composite.</li>

<li><b>Linear Diophantine Equation Solver (LDE): </b>Solve linear Diophantine equations of the form ax + by = c.</li>

<li><b>Prime Factor List Generator: </b>Identify prime factors of a given integer.</li>

<li><b>Factor List Generator: </b>List all factors of a given number.</li>

<li><b>Remainder Calculator: </b>Compute the remainder when one number is divided by another.</li>

<li><b>Coprime Checker: </b>Check if two numbers are coprime (having a GCD of 1).</li>

<li><b>Modulus Calculator:</b> Easily calculate x mod y for any two numbers.</li>
</ul>
